  <h2>The Xva programming language</h2>
</div>


Xva is an interpreted, statically typed programming language, designed to be small, fast, and allow for rapid prototyping. Its syntax is beginner friendly, but also exposes many common and powerful features found in other languages.

Xva started out with us wanting something that satisfied some "gripes" with other languages we have used in a professional context. Some languages didn't have what we wanted, some had unwieldy syntax, and some were just plain weird. So we decided we'd build our own, to make something expressive and easy to use, without compromising its power and productivity.

Xva is still extremely experimental. The team is always open to new ideas and contributions, so if you feel like adding something, please go ahead and make a pull request!
